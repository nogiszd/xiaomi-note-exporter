> Export your notes from Mi Cloud directly to Markdown file! 📝➡️🧾

## 🤔 Why?

I wanted to export my own notes from Mi Cloud but there is no option for that. The only option was to rewrite the notes one by one. So I decided to make an app that would do it for me.

## 💁 How to use?

**DISCLAIMER: This software will work only if you have your notes stored on [Mi Cloud](https://i.mi.com/)**

**Prerequisites :**

- **Windows machine with [_.NET 8 runtime_](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime) installed**
- **Latest version of Google Chrome browser installed**

Download [latest release](https://github.com/nogiszd/xiaomi-note-exporter/releases/latest), extract the contents **to the same folder** and run `xiaomiNoteExporter.exe` executable.

**Steps how to use**:

1.  Launch the app - you will be prompted to input domain address (if it differs from the default one).
2.  Sign into your account via browser window that popped up.
3.  After succeeding, press any key as requested.
4.  Wait until process is done, and you'll be left with _Markdown_ file with your notes exported!

## 🔧 How about maintenance?

I will only add modifications and new features **when I have free time to do so**. Until then, there will only be major bug fixes and small updates (including library updates).

## 🔗 Importing into other apps (Advanced)

There is an **[fork](https://github.com/aviv926/xiaomi-note-exporter)** with additional scripts written in Python which are made to split complete markdown file into one per note, and convert them into JSON format file.

More details are described in this fork's `readme.md`.
